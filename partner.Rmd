I was not able to knit the hw1.Rmd file because Jack saved the image to his personal computer and I don't have that same image on my computer so the execution halted. That was the only error his hw1.Rmd file gave. To test it, I temporarly deleted the image part in the Rmd file and his file would properly knit, but I did add back in the image part after testing that.  

The most difficult part was navigating each others repos and keeping things organized between our group of 3.
